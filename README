1. Introduction
----------------------------------------

 Cockerel is a web based interactive mathematical lesson planner. It allows
 instructors to create mathematical lesson plans using wiki markup and then
 assign these to students.


This code base will be extremely unstable over the summer. If you plan on using
it send me a message.


2. Instructions for Installing
----------------------------------------

If you would like to run this software you must have Coq >= 8.2pl1
installed. Please see the Coq site for installation details; http://coq.inria.fr
 
You must also have Python >= 2.6.5 installed on your system. Please see the
project documentation for installation details; http://www.python.org/download

Once you have satisified these dependencies, you can continue with
installation. I strongly recommend using the virtualenv project for managing the
python namespace. Assuming you have a project python install with setuptools,
you can create a new virutalenv around the project directory to install
into. This can be done with:

        virutalenv some_env_path
        . some_env_path/bin/activate
        easy_install cockerel
        
To start Cockerel run
        cockerel
     
To start Coqd run
        coqd

The Cockerel webpage will be at http://localhost:5000 by default
