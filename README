1. Introduction
----------------------------------------

 Cockerel is a web based interactive theorem prover based on the Coq
 proof assistant. 

This code base will be extremely unstable over the summer. If you plan
on using it send me a message.


2. Instructions for Installing
----------------------------------------

If you would like to run this software you must have Coq >=
8.2pl1 installed. Please see the Coq site for installation
details; http://coq.inria.fr
 
You must also have Python >= 2.6.5 installed on your system. Please
see the project documentation for installation details;
http://www.python.org/download

Once you have satisified these dependencies, you can continue with
installation. I strongly recommend using the virtualenv project for
managing the python namespace. Assuming you have a project python
install with setuptools, you can create a new virutalenv around the
project directory to install into. This can be done with:

        virutalenv <path>/<to>/<repo>

Then activate the repo and execute:

        python setup.py develop

which will pull in all the dependencies needed to run coqd and
webapp.py. At this point you can being running the application by
running
        python webapp/webapp.py
        
Then start coqd in another terminal with
        python coqd/connserv.py

The Cockerel webpage will be at http://localhost:5000 by default
