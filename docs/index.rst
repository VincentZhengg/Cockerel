Welcome to Cockerel's documentation!
====================================

Cockerel is a prover, a lesson planner, and a companion for all education in all areas of mathematics. My experience in mathematical education is only as a student, however it has shown me that no good tools exist for providing a long distance interactive experience. Students have to deal with a system the expects perfection and understanding without any feedback and little to no motivation beyond the threat of failure.

Cockerel is different. It provides an environment that is easy for instructors and students to use by focusing solely on lesson planning. Each class has a number of lesson plans associated with it. The lesson plan is simply a wiki document that instructors can use however they like. By providing any questions and proofs in-line with the instruction, students will have clear references for all their assignments. Additionally, each question or theorem, will be a clickable link to a prover in which the students can complete the questions.
